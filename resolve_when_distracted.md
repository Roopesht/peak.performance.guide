# Advaithi’s Resolve: A Path to Focus and Strength

## Why a Resolve?

Since the time of the Mahabharata, we have seen countless instances where individuals find themselves torn between the comfort of their existing state and the multiple duties (dharmas) that life demands—whether it is Vaiyaktika Dharma (personal duty), Pitru Dharma (duty to ancestors), Mitra Dharma (duty to friends), or Udyoga Dharma (duty to work). The path is never simple, for these duties often conflict, pulling one in different directions. It is even more difficult when these calls arise from beyond the comfort zone, requiring sacrifice, struggle, and change.

The difficulty of choosing is not just in the decision itself, but in the consequences of that choice. When you make a choice that is not aligned with your higher dharma, confusion enters the mind. Slowly, what was once clear becomes muddled. The mind becomes a battlefield of competing desires and conflicting duties. Productivity falters, and the soul begins to lose its direction.

Know this: *The strength to choose rightly comes from a clear mind and a steadfast heart.* As Vivekananda said, *"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."* When faced with such conflicts, you must rise above the turmoil, guided by discernment and inner strength. Let your decisions be made with clarity, rooted in dharma, and supported by the courage to step beyond the comfort of the known.

## Solution

When distractions arise and trouble the mind, weakening my resolve, I shall sit tall, breathe deeply, and let these words resound within. Each line will draw me back to my highest purpose, to the greatness that lies within my reach. In this simple act, I find a powerful tool to instantly refocus my mind and heart. Through practice and intention, these words shall become my guide, a reminder of the strength I embody and the path I am destined to walk.

## Resolve Note

In the spirit of strength and noble purpose, I declare, *‘I am Advaithi.’* My path is bound to high dreams and dharma, to the sacred task of becoming my highest self. Each breath I take is an offering to my inner resolve; each step forward deepens my alignment with purpose.

The past holds no sway over me, for I am free from its grip. What I once was is only a memory, not a force that shapes my present or my future. I am committed only to the light within me and the destiny that calls me forward.

I tread the path of *Viveka*—the path of discernment and wisdom. With each choice, I draw closer to who I am meant to be. My mind stands steady and calm, like a still lake under the sun, reflecting only that which is true and pure. I see distractions for what they are—fleeting clouds passing by—and I am rooted firmly in my purpose.

I hold my own worth sacred and honor the power within me. My mind is my instrument, tuned to serve my highest ideals. Today, my task is my offering, my devotion, and I will complete it with joy and clarity, for it is in the fulfillment of duty that the soul finds peace.

I am Advaithi, and with each step, I draw nearer to the vision I hold within. My future self awaits, and my dreams stand vibrant and ready. I am alive in this purpose, and I rise to meet it with unwavering strength.
