## Pranayama Schedule

**Total Pranayama Duration:** At least 30 minutes.

## Required Mindset

Pranayama is a tool to realize the true Self, reminding you that you are already complete. It calms the mind and body, grounding you in awareness, so that you can act effortlessly and stay focused. Through breath control, distractions dissolve, and you enter a state of flow where action becomes natural and effective.

Success or failure will no longer define you; clarity and focus on your goals will. The energy gained through pranayama is not just for personal benefit—it is for recognizing your connection with all life. As you develop discipline, your sense of separation fades, leaving only pure awareness.

Peak performance occurs when you act in alignment with your true nature—free, infinite, and at peace. You will come to see yourself not only as the doer, but also as the tool and the process. Everything, from the machinery to the people, will work together as one harmonious flow.

## Pranayama Practices

### 1. **Bhastrika**  
   - Inhale deeply through both nostrils, filling the abdomen and lungs completely.  
   - Exhale slowly and thoroughly, emptying the lungs completely.  
   - One cycle consists of both inhalation and exhalation.  
   - Start with 4 seconds per cycle (2 seconds for inhalation and 2 seconds for exhalation). As you progress, reduce the duration of each cycle to 2 seconds or less. The key is to maintain equal duration for both inhalation and exhalation.  
   - Begin with 30 cycles and gradually increase the number to up to 300 cycles as your practice deepens.  
   - Focus the mind fully on the breath, maintaining a calm and steady awareness.

### 2. **Kapalabhati**  
   - Perform 300 rapid exhalations, focusing on the Ajna Chakra (the space between the eyebrows).  
   - Each exhalation should be swift and powerful, completely emptying the abdomen. The inhalation should be passive, occurring naturally as a reflex after the exhalation.  
   - This practice should take approximately 6 minutes to complete.  
   - For advanced practitioners, the repetitions can be increased up to 900, but this should be done gradually.  
   - You can take breaks during the practice. Each break should begin with **Dhauti** (cleansing) followed by 3 cycles of normal, natural breathing.  
   - It is recommended not to open the eyes during breaks, maintaining internal focus and calm.

### 3. **Anuloma Viloma**  
   - Perform at least 9 rounds of Anuloma Viloma (alternate nostril breathing).  
   - One cycle consists of inhaling through the left nostril, exhaling through the right nostril, inhaling through the right nostril, and exhaling through the left nostril.  
   - Begin the process with a complete exhalation through the left nostril.  
   - Inhale slowly and deeply, allowing the breath to fill your lungs.  
   - Exhale even more slowly, ensuring thoroughness in the release of air.  
   - Focus your attention on the Ajna Chakra, visualizing a white light entering as you inhale and expanding to clear distractions as you exhale.  
   - Be mindful of the energy flow throughout the body during each cycle.  
   - The duration for inhalation and exhalation should be determined by your yoga guru, considering your sharira prakriti, ailments, and aspirations. If you have not yet found a guru, start with 5 seconds for inhalation followed by 5 seconds for exhalation.
   - You can increase it up to 27 cycles. Beyond that take the permission from the guru.


### 4. **Moola Bandha Kumbhaka Pranayama**  
   - Consult with your yoga guru before practicing this pranayama.
   - Start with 10 repetitions of Bhastrika to prepare the body.  
   - Perform one round of Moola Bandha Kumbhaka:  
     - Inhale (Puraka) for 5 seconds, gradually increasing to 12 seconds.  
     - Engage **Moola Bandha** (root lock) by contracting the pelvic floor muscles and **Jalandhara Bandha** (throat lock) by tucking the chin.  
     - Hold your breath (Kumbhaka) while maintaining the Bandhas, focusing on the Ajna Chakra. The breath retention should be four times the duration of Puraka.  
     - Exhale (Rechaka) slowly, releasing the throat lock first, then the root lock. The exhalation should be twice the duration of Puraka.  
   - Repeat this process for 3 rounds, with a maximum of 9 rounds under optimal conditions.

### 5. **Trataka**  
   - Sit in silence for 30 seconds, appreciating the stillness.  
   - Gaze at the flame of a deepam (oil lamp) for 3 minutes, bringing focus to the third eye (Ajna Chakra).  
   - Finish with 2 minutes of silence, allowing the mind to absorb the calmness.

## Japa Schedule  
**Total Duration**: At least 15 minutes  
**Between Each Mantra**: Pause for 10 seconds to enjoy the stillness and immerse in the silence.

**Required Mindset**:  
As I engage in Japa, I remind myself that the mantras are not separate from my true Self; they are the vibrations of the divine consciousness that flows through all of creation. Each mantra, each syllable, is a portal to deeper awareness. This practice quiets the mind, dissolves the ego, and brings me into harmony with my true nature. Through Japa, I tap into the inherent flow state of peak performance that exists within me. Every repetition brings me closer to the oneness of the universe, guiding me toward stillness, clarity, and greater focus. The pauses between mantras are sacred moments, where silence helps me reconnect with my infinite, undivided awareness. Japa is not merely a ritual; it is a spiritual journey that leads me to embody my highest potential and align with the cosmic consciousness.

### 1. **Recite the Prarthana (Prayer)**
   Begin by offering prayers to the following deities for blessings and guidance:  
   - **Ganesha**: Remover of obstacles
