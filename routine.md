# Peak Performance program
Version: Adwaithi in the pursuit of meaningful worldly goals.

## Physical exercise

- 13 rounds of surya namaskara
- Essential yogasana (cat pose, matsyasana, Paschimottanasana)

## Pranayama Schedule
Total Pranayama length should be more than half hour.

**Required Mindset**: 
Pranayama helps me realize my true Self and reminds me that I am already complete. 
It quiets my mind and body, grounding me in awareness so I can act effortlessly and stay focused. 
By regulating my breath, distractions disappear, and I enter a flow state where action becomes natural and effective.
Success or failure doesn’t define me, and I remain clear and focused on my goals. 
The energy I gain through pranayama is not just for personal benefit but for recognizing my connection with all life.
With discipline, my sense of separation fades, leaving only pure awareness. 
True peak performance comes when I act in alignment with my true nature—free, infinite, and at peace.
Peak performance is when I see myself not only as the doer, but also as the tool and the process. Everything becomes one seamless action. 
I visualize that the entire machinery, spirit, and people are all part of me, working together as one.

## Japa Schedule
Total Japa Schedule should be at least 15 minutes.
Between each mantra place a brief gap of 10 seconds and enjoy the stillness.

**Required Mindset**: As I engage in Japa, I recognize that the mantras are not separate from my true Self; they are expressions of the same divine consciousness that pervades all. This practice serves as a powerful tool for calming my mind and dissolving the ego, allowing me to tap into the peak performance and flow state inherent in my nature. Each recitation brings me closer to the realization of oneness with the universe, facilitating a deep stillness and clarity that enhances my ability to focus on my goals. I embrace the pauses between mantras as moments to immerse myself in silence, reinforcing the understanding that I am the infinite awareness behind all experiences. Ultimately, Japa is not just a ritual for me; it is a profound journey toward recognizing and embodying my highest potential.
