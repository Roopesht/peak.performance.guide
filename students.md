## Setup Mind - Level 1
For those new to the path of yoga or aiming for peak performance, this foundational practice will prepare and steady the mind.

1. **Bhastrika (1-second intervals)**
   Begin with short, vigorous breaths. Inhale and exhale forcefully, one breath per second. This will awaken and energize the mind and body, igniting the spirit with new vitality.

2. **Bhastrika (5-second intervals)**
   Next, slow the pace to five seconds per breath. Inhale deeply, filling the lungs completely, then exhale slowly. This controlled breathing soothes the mind and stabilizes the body, creating the foundation for calm concentration.

3. **Shloka Recitation**
   Recite the sacred mantra:  
   *Sri Rama Rama Rameti Rame Raame Manorame, Sahasranamatha Tulyam, Rama Nama Varanane.*
   
   This mantra invokes the divine presence of Lord Rama, embodying peace, courage, and focus. Let each syllable resonate within, clearing the mind of distractions and centering it in higher purpose.

4. **Establish a Calm, Stable, and Focused Mind**
   After the breathing and mantra, sit in stillness. Allow the mind to settle into a state of calm stability. This is the foundation for focus. Know that a calm and stable mind is like a powerful, steady flameâ€”it illuminates without wavering.

5. **Visualize**
   Now, visualize your goal or ideal clearly and with conviction. See yourself fully engaged, strong, and unwavering. Feel the energy of success flowing through you as though you have already achieved it. This vision becomes the guiding light, aligning your thoughts and actions toward your highest purpose.

Remember, these practices are not just exercises but steps on the path to self-mastery. They are designed to cultivate strength, clarity, and inner peace. As you practice, know that you are shaping the mind, preparing it for the heights of achievement and wisdom. Begin with humility, continue with faith, and let each practice draw you closer to the greatness within.
