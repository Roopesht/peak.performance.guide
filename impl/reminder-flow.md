# Reminder System Workflow

The system provides a robust reminder mechanism to ensure tasks are managed efficiently. Here's how it works:

## Step 1: Task Association with Date and Time
- **Task Setup**: Each task associated with a goal is assigned a specific date and time, whether it is a one-time or recurring task.
- **Customization**: The user sets preferences for advance reminders.

## Step 2: Reminder Notification
- **Pre-Task Reminder**:
  - Reminders are shown to the user before the task starts, based on their preferences.
  - The reminders include **contextual information** such as:
    - Associated goal
    - Severity and importance
    - Additional notes or instructions.

- **User Actions**:
  - The user can choose one of the following options:
    - **Snooze**: Postpone the reminder for a specified duration.
    - **Mark as Not Required**: Skip the task if deemed unnecessary.
    - **Mark as Completed**: Mark the task as done immediately.

- **Task Notes**:
  - The user can add details or notes to the task, which are stored for future reference.

- **Task Assistance**:
  - The system offers help resources, such as:
    - Simplified methods to accomplish the task.
    - Relevant reference documents or guides.

## Step 3: Reminder for Task Completion
- **Completion Reminder**:
  - When the task reaches its deadline, another reminder is triggered.
  - **User Options**:
    - **Mark as Complete**: Confirm the task's completion.
    - **Need Help**: Request additional assistance (e.g., guides, references, or troubleshooting).

- **Feedback Collection**:
  - If the task is marked complete, the system prompts for feedback, such as:
    - Overall task experience.
    - Challenges faced or suggestions for improvement.

## Step 4: Optional Disabling of Reminders
- **User Preference**:
  - The user can opt out of receiving reminders entirely.

### Additional Considerations
- **Framework Finalization**: Details of the exact reminder framework (timing, frequency, user interface) are yet to be finalized.
- **Adaptive Reminders**: The system may adjust reminder frequency and content based on user interactions and preferences.
- **Dashboard Integration**: A centralized view of all reminders and their statuses is provided for user convenience.
