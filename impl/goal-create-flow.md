# Peak Performance Workflow

The Peak Performance System operates in the following streamlined flow:

## Step 1: Goal Selection
- **User Action**: The user selects a goal they want to achieve.
- **System Support**: The system asks the user to identify specific areas of difficulty related to the goal.
- **User Action**: The user enters the difficulty

## Step 2: Self-Assessment
- **User Action**: The system provides an assessment tailored to the selected goal and difficulty areas.
- **System Response**: The user completes the assessment.

## Step 3: AI Evaluation and Validation
- **System Action**: The AI evaluates the completed assessment and generates a detailed report.
- **User Action**: The user reviews and validates the AI-generated results.

## Step 4: Next Steps and Plan Generation
- **System Action**: Upon validation, the system provides actionable next steps based on the assessment results.
- **User Interaction**: The user answers additional questions to refine the plan.
- **System Output**: The system converts these steps into a personalized plan aligned with user preferences.

## Step 5: Task Tracking
- **System Action**: Tasks from the plan are tracked within the system and shown as reminders.
- **User Action**: The user marks tasks as either "Completed" or "Not Completed."

## Step 6: Handling Incomplete Tasks
- **System Action**: For tasks marked as "Not Completed," the system collects additional data to analyze obstacles.
